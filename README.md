# Manifold CLI

This code base contains the prototype Manifold CLI.

Please view the [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md) documentation for
guidance on how to install and use the command line tool.

You can download a release of the Manifold CLI from the
[Releases](https://github.com/manifoldco/manifold-cli/releases) section of this
repository.

## Writing Code

Any new change in behaviour, whether it's a new feature *or* bug fix, should be
documented in the CHANGELOG.md as a part of a pull request submission!

## Local Configuration

To point the CLI at a local instance of the Marketplace, add the following lines
to a `.manifoldrc` file in your home directory.

```
hostname = arigato.tools
scheme = http
analytics = false
```

## Releasing

Releasing the `manifold-cli` is a manual process run on a developers local machine.

1. Ensure all of the required code has been merged into master.
2. Ensure the CHANGELOG.md is up to date!
3. Create a tag off master (following [semver](http://semver.org/)), which
   matches the remote sha of master on github.
4. Build the cli locally from scratch (`make clean; make`)
5. Create the build zips (`make zips`)
6. Create a release on github for the tag which includes the changelog for this
   release and upload the build zips.
7. Done!

## OpenAPI Specs

Currently, the open api specs contained within this repository are the versions
we create for the browser minus any non-public `x-go-type` reference.

They are generated by building the js client and then modifying the files.

This is only a patch work solution!
