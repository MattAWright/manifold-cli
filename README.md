# Manifold CLI

This code base contains the prototype Manifold CLI.

Please view the [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md) documentation for
guidance on how to install and use the command line tool.

You can download a release of the Manifold CLI from the
[Releases](https://github.com/manifoldco/manifold-cli/releases) section of this
repository.

## Releasing

Releasing the `manifold-cli` is a manual process run on a developers local machine.

1. Ensure all of the required code has been merged into master.
3. Create a tag off master (following [semver](http://semver.org/)), which matches the remote sha of master
   on github.
4. Build the cli locally from scratch (`make clean; make`)
5. Create the build zips (`make zips`)
6. Create a release on github for the tag which includes the changelog for this
   release and upload the build zips.
7. Done!

## OpenAPI Specs

Currently, the open api specs contained within this repository are the versions
we create for the browser minus any non-public `x-go-type` reference.

They are generated by building the js client and then modifying the files.

This is only a patch work solution!
